# A\* Pathfinding demo

This project allows you to visualize the A\* pathfinding algorithm in a grid environment. You can interact with the grid by adding obstacles, setting start and end points, and exploring how the algorithm finds the shortest path in real-time.

Features:

- Interactive Grid: Click and drag to add obstacles or move the start/end points.
- Multiple Heuristics: Choose between different heuristics (e.g., Manhattan, Euclidean) to see how they affect the algorithm’s performance.
- Real-Time Path Calculation: Watch as the A\* algorithm calculates the path dynamically based on your grid setup.
